Puri recipe
1. Mix or sieve the whole wheat flour with salt. Add melted ghee or oil. Add little water at a time and knead well to form a dough with hands or with the help of a stand mixer.
2. The dough should not be soft like the dough of the chapati or roti, but a little stiff and tight.
3. Divide the dough into small or medium pieces – about 12 to 14. Make into medium sized or slightly small balls.
4. Apply oil to dough ball. The idea of applying oil and not dusting with flour is so that while frying, the oil stays clean and you won’t see dark burnt flour particles inside the oil.
5. Roll the dough evenly into circles which are neither too thin nor thick.
6. Place the rolled poori in a plate and cover with a clean kitchen towel, so that they don’t dry up.
7. Heat oil in a deep frying pan or kadai. When the oil is sufficiently hot, then drop a small dough ball into oil. If the dough ball rises steadily & briskly to the top, then the oil is sufficiently hot to fry the poori. Otherwise, wait till the oil becomes hot before frying the poori. if the dough ball rises slowly or is still at the bottom, then the oil is cold and if it rises too fast, then the oil is very hot.
8. Add one puri at a time. It will puff up soon.
9. Once the bottom side is golden, then turn over the poori and fry gently pressing down with the frying spoon or slotted spoon in a circular motion. Fry the poori till golden brown all over.
